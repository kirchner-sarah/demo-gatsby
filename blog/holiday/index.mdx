# 1. August: It is Holidays

Holidays are a time of joy, relaxation, and celebration. They allow us to take a break from our daily routines and
spend quality time with loved ones. Whether it's a national holiday, a religious celebration, or simply a day off work,
holidays hold a special place in our hearts.
